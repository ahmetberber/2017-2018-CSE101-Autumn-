<p align = "justify" >At first sight, artificial intelligence, called "Artificial Intelligence" in the literature, has an association with something different. According to some, the concept of artificial intelligence evokes an electromechanical robot, like a human being who takes the place of human beings. But everyone involved in this field knows that there is a definite difference between man and machine. Computers seem to never have the ability to convey the creativity, emotion, and mood of human beings with the present technology. However, it is possible that computers have the ability to manipulate machines, such as robots that perform certain physical human behaviors, and have the ability to brainstorm systems that simulate the human thinking process related to a particular area of ​​expertise, such as data computation, medical diagnosis, In this way, there are successful applications and there is no commercial effect. Computers can do some simple functions of human intelligence better; perform mathematical calculations, process numbers and letters, make simple decisions, and carry out different functions of storing and accessing information. In such applications, computers are very good and often pass people's performance. Because even the computers used in the houses are doing the multiplication of the two numbers of 5-6 digits at the level of the nano-seconds. Or it immediately reveals how many of a certain lie in a book are well below the perception of a person. Computers greatly simplify and accelerate certain aspects of human thinking processes. With artificial intelligence technology applications, we can not automatically expand the complex operations that are done manually. In addition, artificial intelligence technologies are integrated with other computer based information systems, and the capabilities and applicability of computers are rapidly increasing.</p>
