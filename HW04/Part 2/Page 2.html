<p align = "justify" >Naturally, there will be many definitions of "Artificial Intelligence", which has numerous fields of application. Here is a section on which: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is aimed at making machines that normally can perform tasks that require human intelligence. The purpose of ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE investigations is to make computers that we can observe in human beings and display behaviors we call "intelligent behavior". ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE can be regarded as all of the efforts to form the mechanism that can perform tasks that require natural intelligence, when done in general by man. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE is the science of making computers intelligent and is being applied by those who want to make computers more useful and those who want to understand the nature of intelligence.The purpose of those who are concerned with the nature of intelligence is not to imitate intelligence, but to make the program intelligent. It can be said that Artificial Intelligence is concerned with the two basic ideas of structure in terms of all these definitions or differences. The first of these; researching the human thought process in order to understand what intelligence is, and the second is the process of computers, robots, and so on. to be embodied and embodied. In the light of all these explanations, the most accepted definition of artificial intelligence can be set out as follows: Artificial intelligence is also the machine-made behavior (intelligent behavior) that is called intelligence when done by man; or artificial intelligence is a theory that shows how human mind works.</p>
