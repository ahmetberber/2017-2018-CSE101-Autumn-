<p align = "justify" >Prehistoric Period: Thousands of years ago, humanity had a hard-to-understand thought; to create an intelligence out of the human body. It is possible to come across a number of examples in ancient Greek mythology in this regard; Daedelus, known as the creator of the wind, attempts to create an artificial-human being as an example. The most important turning point for artificial intelligence is 1884. At this time, a scientist named Charles Babbage was experimenting with a number of mechanical machines he wanted to show some intelligent behavior. Finally, in 1950, a scientist named Shannon argued that computers could play chess, as the work on these machines, agreed on not to be as intelligent as human beings, lasted until 1950. Thus, the studies at the beginning of the period named under the prehistoric name continued at a rapid pace, which was not so rapid until the early 1960s.</p>
<p align = "justify" >Born: Artificial intelligence was born in 1956, the date of a conference held in the United States in Dartmouth, bringing together a group of high-level scientists. In this conference, J. McCarthy, M. Minsky, C. Shannon, A. Newell, and H. Simon proposed to investigate the possibility of implementing computer programs equipped with intelligence. The Artificial Intelligence term which has been put forward by this means has started to be used. The first artificial intelligence programs (a Logic theorem practitioner, Logic Theorist and a chess game program, both Newell and Simon) and LISP (artificial intelligence programming language) also appeared in this period. In fact, the interest of a person's "intelligent" machines depends very much on the former. A scientific planner, on the one hand, theoretical and practical developments on automata, and mathematical logic studies, on the other hand, are the first foundations of artificial intelligence. Firstly, Babbage (and "analytical" machine, 1842), Turing (and universal machine, 1936) and cybernetics (born in 1943, especially born with Wiener) reveal the importance of counter reactionary events in the process of obtaining brain information. Secondly, important works on the insolubility and incompleteness that led to the proof of the fact of the existence of the problem that the solution was not algorithmic (ie, the solution was not expressed as a sequence of limited operations that took place in a certain order) towards 1930. Leibniz, Boole, Hilbert, Gödel and Church It belongs. The real factor that led to the birth of real artificial intelligence is the emergence of computers towards 1943. From this period on, some pioneers have dealt with the issue of equipping these machines with some intelligence. Thus, in 1950, mathematician A. Turing put forward a test that allows a machine to decide whether it is intelligent or not. This test, along with the basic rule of argument, shows that the intelligence given to the intelligence of computers from this period is good.</p>
<p align = "justify" >Dartmouth Conference: The beginning of this conference; It can also be described as the birth of a new age of artificial intelligence. This conference organized by Dartmouth College was the first to learn the name Artificial Intelligence (AI), and participants in this conference were recognized as pioneers of artificial intelligence. These include Marvin Minsky (founder of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT), Claude Shannon, Nathaniel Rochester (IBM), Allen Newell (first president of the American Artificial Intelligence Association), and Herbert Simon, Nobel Prize winner. Some important successes achieved during this period can be illustrated as an example of a program used to distinguish similar geometric shapes in intelligence tests. The achievements of this period unfortunately started the very early and unrealistic expectation period about the creation of intelligent computers.</p>
<p align = "justify" >The Dark Period (1965-1970): The fact that very few things can be developed in this period is enough to justify such a qualification. The overly optimistic and hasty attitude created in the previous period convinced the scientists involved that intelligent computers were a very easy process. As a result, computer specialists are struggling to develop a mechanism in the philosopher's kind, hoping to build intelligent computers by loading only the data. As a result, this period was literally a dark waiting period.</p>
<p align = "justify" >Renaissance Period (1970-1975): This period can not be overcome anymore is perceived as a beginning. Artificial intelligence specialists by developing systems, trying to predict the results with excitement today, long and thrills an exciting adventure.</p>
<p align = "justify" >Partnership Period (1975-1980): Artificial intelligence researchers saw that they could benefit from other fields of science, such as language and psychology, just after the Renaissance period.</p>
